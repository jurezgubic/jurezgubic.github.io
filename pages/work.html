<p>This is a UCLA-LES of the RICO campaign with 1 minute temporal output and 25m spatial resolution. A shallow maritime convection event</p>


<h2> Analysis of the simulation</h2>

<p>Using a cloudtracker tool, you can track clouds across timesteps, record their characterstics and produce a plot of how the relationship between their branchiness and maximum height. Brachiness is defined as the ratio between the surface area of a cloud divided by the surface area that a sphere with the equivalent cloud volume would have. The red and blue dots represent cloud that have stronger or weaker updraft velocities upon their identification.</p>
